This repository contains the code used for the experiments in the paper.

To install all the required packages, please follow the guide [here](https://github.com/isds-neu/EQDiscovery).

We have applied the method designed by Chen et al. in their paper:

Chen, Z., Liu, Y. & Sun, H. Physics-informed learning of governing equations from scarce data. *Nat Commun* 12, 6136 (2021). [https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-26434-1](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-26434-1).

The code is heavily inspired by theirs with a few modifications.
